# first-project
# what did we do in this project? 

- When viewing the souce code, I added semantic HTML elements.
- When I view the structure of the HTML elements then I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
- Added ALT attributes to the images.
- Added sequential order to the heading attributes.
- Made a concise, descriptive title.
